# Sorting-Algorithms-Cpp

## Overview

Welcome to the Sorting-Algorithms-Cpp repository! This project showcases the implementation of various sorting algorithms in C++. The primary focus is to demonstrate the efficiency and functionality of sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quicksort, heap sort, and counting sort. Each algorithm is meticulously implemented and tested to ensure correctness and performance.

## Features

- **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its stability and efficient performance.
- **Quicksort:** A highly efficient sorting algorithm based on the partitioning of the data array.
- **Heap Sort:** A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
- **Counting Sort:** An integer sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of occurrences of each distinct element.

## Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
- **Libraries:** No external libraries are required.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thonos-cpu/Sorting-Algorithms-Cpp.git
   cd Sorting-Algorithms-Cpp
Compile the Code:

sh
g++ main.cpp -o sorting-algorithms
Run the Program:

sh
./sorting-algorithms
Usage
